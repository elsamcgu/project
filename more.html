<h2>About the Dales</h2>

 <p>
    The Yorkshire Dales has many moods; it can be wild and windswept or quietly tranquil.
    <br>
    <br>
    It includes some of the finest limestone scenery in the UK, 
    from crags and pavements to an underground labyrinth of caves. 
    Each valley or 'dale' has its own distinct character, 
    set against expansive heather moorland tops.
    <br>
    <br>
    Stone-built villages sit amongst traditional farming landscapes of field barns,
    drystone walls and flower-rich hay meadows, and show how the area has been shaped
    over thousands of years by the people who have lived and worked here.
    <br>
    <br>
    Spectacular waterfalls and ancient broadleaved woodland contrast with the scattered remains of former mine workings and other rural industries which remind us of the areaâ€™s rich industrial heritage
